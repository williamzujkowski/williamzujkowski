## About Me: The TL;DR Version

-   :zap: I make cloud infrastructure that's **secure-by-design** (because patching is so last season). I speak fluent **automation** and can spin up a **CI/CD** pipeline faster than you can say "OWASP Top 10." (using **GitHub Actions**, **Terraform**, and a sprinkle of magic DevSecOps tools).
-   :handshake: I'm a team player (a spoonful of sugar makes the CVEs go down). I enjoy herding developers, wrangling ops, and generally translating "tech" into "human."
-   :brain: My brain is a sponge for new threat vectors, zero-trust architectures, and container security vulnerabilities. (Don't worry, I won't bore you with the details... unless you ask nicely.)
-   :raised_hands: Open-source enthusiast and firm believer that knowledge is meant to be shared (unlike my Netflix password).

## Current Projects: What's Keeping Me Busy

-   **Security Automation Pipelines**
    :construction: Building CI/CD pipelines that automatically scan, test, and deploy secure container images. (Because manual security checks are *so* 2010s.)

-   **Zero Trust Architecture**
    :detective: Experimenting with open-source tools to implement zero trust. (Trust no one, not even your own code.)

-   **Secure Cloud Native Apps**
    :closed_lock_with_key: Hardening PaaS environments like a digital Fort Knox. (FedRAMP compliance is my jam).
